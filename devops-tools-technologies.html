<h2>Configuration Management</h2>
<p>Configuration management (CM) tools usually track updates, changes, code improvements and the versions that have been applied to software code repository, the tracking also covers locations and network addresses of hardware devices. If a system ever needs a software or hardware upgrade, the developers can access the Configuration management program and access the database to see what are the updates are currently installed and helps the developer then to make a more informed decision about the upgradations and features needed.</p>
<ul class="banner-ul ">
<p class="text-left"><strong>The advantages of software configuration management (SCM) are:</strong></p>
<li style="width:100%">It effectively manages and tracks the updates to the code.</li>
<li style="width:100%">Configuration management tools do redundant tasks, instead gives the developers more time to invest in other tasks.</li>
<li style="width:100%">While it avoids configuration related problems, it is also useful in creating a collaborative work environment.</li>

<h3>Chef</h3>
<p>The chef is the best known as an infrastructure automation platform and is very popular with our DevOps service provider, it is a straightforward scripting language which turns infrastructure into the code, one thing why Chef is popular and popular in DevOps community. This unique ability of Chef reduces all the unpredictability associated with configuring, even with quite complicated operational environments to the simple computer program one that DevOps teams can manage as they would any other code. Chef sets the bar for DevOps automation across the DevOps tools landscape according to our DevOps service providers. The advantage of Chef is the feature of infrastructure as code translates as the code is flexible, reachable and traceable code changes, codes are human readable and easily testable according to the changes to the main repository.</p>

<h3>Puppet Labs</h3>
<p>Puppet is a tool that helps DevOps service providers in managing the IT infrastructure especially associated with configuration management of DevOps services at a considerably faster speed without compromising on security concerns and accuracy issues. Puppet is a configuration management tool that assists our DevOps service providers to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of a server infrastructure. It runs on many platforms such as may open source OS, Linux, Microsoft Windows and with its declarative language to describe configuration to provide customized configuration management options. Puppet is made by Puppet Labs, the brainchild of Luke Kanies in 2005. It is written and coded in Ruby and was released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL) until version 2.7.0 and the Apache License 2.0 after that.</p>

<h3>Ansible</h3>
<p>Ansible is an open source, powerful automation software for configuring, managing and deploying software applications on remote nodes. According to our DevOps service providers, Ansible is designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models IT infrastructure by describing how all of the nodes interrelate, rather than just managing one node at a time. To perform these configuration management operations, no downtime is required on either the controller machine (where Ansible is present) or the machines that are provisioned to run through it. In addition, there is no need for agents running on the remote hosts (unlike the competition in this category) just a passwordless SSH connection between the controller system and the remote nodes. Ansible works by connecting all the nodes and by pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to the remote nodes. These Ansible programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system or as the desired output of the program.</p>

<h3>AWS OpsWorks</h3>
<p>Amazon Web Service’s OpsWorks is designed for IT administrators and DevOps-minded developers, this tool help them to easy to manage applications of nearly any scale and complexity without compromising on the security and code integrity. OpsWorks allows our DevOps service providers to create logical architectures, marshall resources depending on architecture structure, deploying applications and all supporting software and packages in a specific configuration, and it helps in the operation and maintenance of the application through the entire software development cycle and the stages of auto-scaling events and software updates.</p>
<p>Configuration management has been traditionally, a complex and time-consuming task because the DevOps service providers have had to choose among different types of configuration management metrics which come with specifically defined flexibility, reduced control, or the required time to develop and deploy custom tooling. Designed to simplify the processes across the entire application development lifecycle, AWS’s OpsWorks overcomes these obstacles by providing an end-to-end flexibility, automated solutions that provide more operational control over applications.</p>

<h2>Containerization</h2>
<p>Containerization tools are defined as software which provides an enterprise-level framework for integrating and managing containers at a required scale. These tools are aimed to simplify the otherwise complicated container management process and provide a framework, which is not only suited for defining the initial container deployment parameters but also for managing the multiple containers entities as one single entity for the purposes of availability, scaling, and networking metrics.</p>

<p>Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers and it is the preferred tool of our DevOps support team for containerization. Docker uses Linux Kernel features such as namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system.
While the concept of containerization is not entirely new, what difference docker brings is according to our DevOps support team, the ease for anyone within the development cycle to use them, be it a   developer, systems admin, architect and others   to take the complete advantage of containers in order to quickly build, integrate and test portable applications. Docker allows concerned talent to package an application on their workstation, this can be executed to run unmodified on any public cloud, private cloud, or even bare metal. According to our DevOps support team, Docker containers are very extremely lightweight and fast.</p>
<p>Containerizations tools are just sandboxed environments running on the Linux much more specifically kernel, due to the fact that they take up fewer resources. Anyone can create and run a Docker container in seconds, when compared with VMs. Docker users also benefit from the increasingly rich and lively ecosystem of Docker Hub, which you can think of as an “app store for Docker” maintained by the Docker community. With Docker, it is easier to link multiple containers together to create an application, this makes it easy to scale up, scale down or update components independently inside the container.</p>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control systems are a set of software tools which help a software development team to manage and track changes to source code over time. Version control softwares keeps track of every modification to the codes in the database. If a mistake is made or a bug arises which does not seem to go away, developers can always turn back to earlier versions of the code to compare, this helps to fix the mistake while minimizing disruption and time consumption to the team.</p>

<h3>Github</h3>
<p>The largest hub of source code in the world and trusted since its release in 2008. Github provides both distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionalities. The large community of Github has made it a popular destination for aspiring developers and for those who want to step up their game. According to our DevOps consultants, Github is also popular due to its overall simplicity of use and navigation, the expertise of the community and the frequent updates which it provides. Features like integrated code search, bug tracking, and availability of servers. Our DevOps experts say that Github has transformed how companies and organizations view the CD/CI process due to Github, the version control tools have changed how codes are tracked and managed.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>
<p>To get far ahead of the competition, Git uses a feature called the branching model.
This basically means that Git allows and encourages the developers to have multiple local branches of a single program that can be entirely independent of each other. This division of codes makes the process of coding, creation, debugging, merging, and deletion of specific lines of development easy to track, manage and in cases, to find also. Our DevOps consultants prefer Git to handle large and complex projects due to advantages such as contexts switching, which allows a developer to create an entirely new branch. In this branch, developers can be creative, commit to few lines with ever disturbing the original branch.</p>
<p>Another reason why our DevOps consultants love Git is due to its hierarchy access or the role-based code lines feature, which only allows only specific developers to access to specific parts of the program. Our DevOps consultants also love flowchart based feature which basically charts the changes to codes independently.</p>

<h3>Gitlab</h3>
<p>Used by NASA, IBM, Sony, Alibaba and SpaceX and written in Google’s in-house code Go. According to our DevOps consultants, the popularity of Gitlab comes due to the multitude of features which Gitlab provides. It has to be also noted that Gitlab provides the largest of tools to even the free users. Features such as CI/CD tools, cycle analytics, issue boards, time tracking, etc. The enterprise version of this tool comes with even more tools which basically blows away the competition. Another feature of Gitlab is security and privacy of the codes, according to our DevOps consultants Gitlab has easy compatibility with all the tools discussed here.</p>

<h3>BitBucket</h3>
<p>Preferred by professional developers with private proprietary code, this what Bitbucket has tailored itself towards. But while it may not features or tools like its competition, the edge comes from the fact that Bitbucket is owned by Atlassian, the parent company also owns products like Jira, HipChat, Confluence and Bamboo. Thus making this tool highly compatible with tools which are associated with collaboration, CD/CI, monitoring tools. This connection actually makes Bitbucket the most well-rounded tool overall if not individually. According to our DevOps consultants, the pricing is another area where BitBucket excels, developers get choose custom plans specifically according to their needs, something which the competitors lack.</p>
